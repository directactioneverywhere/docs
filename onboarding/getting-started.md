# Getting Started

Interested in joining the Tech Working Group? Come to a meeting! Even if you don't have tech skills, there's always work to be done.

## About the Tech Working Group

The Tech Working Group's mission is to make DxE activists more effective using technology.

We work on things like the activist database, DxE's website, analytics, etc.

## Meetings

The Tech Working Group normally meets twice a week, on Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 7pm. On Tuesdays, we meet in person in San Francisco (usually Noisebridge), and on Wednesdays we meet in person at the DxE house in Berkeley. If you're new, we encourage you to come in person, but you're also welcome to join online.

We meet online using Jitsi Meet: https://meet.jit.si/dxetech

If you want to come to a meeting, join the chatroom here to confirm the meeting location with us: https://riot.im/app/#/room/#dxetech:matrix.org

Our meetings are usually 2-2.5 hours long.

## Tasks

We keep track of tasks on this WeKan board (it's like Trello): https://board.uptwinkles.co/b/v324MbaJgPQ4oygaf/dxe-tech

Feel free to pick any task to work on, even if you haven't been to a meeting.
