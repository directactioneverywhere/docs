## Make DxE activists more effective through technology
 - Make progress on Tech WG tasks. (Not measured, but it could be.)
 - Make sure all working groups know that they can ask for help from us for new projects or as “tech support”. Measure with a quarterly survey sent to all working groups.
 - Specifically work more closely with the Outreach and Protest working groups to make sure their needs are met, and go above and beyond to help them with projects. Measure with a more detailed quarterly survey sent to Outreach and Protest working groups.
