                                <h1 id="how-to-join">How to Join</h1>
<p>To join the tech working group, new people need to meet the tech working group standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have come to three meetings (in person or over video chat)</li>
<li>Agree with DxE&#x2019;s organizing principles: <a href="http://www.directactioneverywhere.com/organizing-principles" target="_blank">http://www.directactioneverywhere.com/organizing-principles</a></li>
<li>Agree to follow through with DxE Tech Membership responsibilities (see Responsibilities section below)</li>
<li>The consensus of a quorum of tech working group members, where quorum is defined as more than half of the total membership.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the new member has been voted on, do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send them the working group agreement. After they&#x2019;ve filled it out, Almira will add them to all the correct communication channels (e.g. fb groups, mailing lists). Link: <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/directactioneverywhere.com/forms/d/1PvrlnLjNEFTyPwXFWks7AZaPFq6BaK3FueFpM7QF4qw/edit" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/a/directactioneverywhere.com/forms/d/1PvrlnLjNEFTyPwXFWks7AZaPFq6BaK3FueFpM7QF4qw/edit</a></li>
<li>Add them to the dxe tech riot chatroom and encourage them to install the riot app: <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#dxetech:matrix.org" target="_blank">https://riot.im/app/#/room/#dxetech:matrix.org</a></li>
<li>Add them to the wekan board: <a href="https://board.uptwinkles.co" target="_blank">https://board.uptwinkles.co</a></li>
<li>Grant access to relevant github repo(s): <a href="https://github.com/dxe" target="_blank">https://github.com/dxe</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You don&#x2019;t need to be a member of the tech working group to sit in on meetings. Basically joining means you&#x2019;ve made a commitment to the tech team and you get access to the mailing list.</p>
<h1 id="member-responsibilities">Member Responsibilities</h1>
<p>Tech working group members have certain responsibilities that they try to uphold. We want DxE Tech to be an inclusive group: it&#x2019;s awesome if you come and do a lot of DxE Tech work, it&#x2019;s awesome if you come and just do non-DxE Tech work, it&#x2019;s awesome if you come and just chill with folks! Everyone who comes contributes something valuable to the tech working group.</p>
<p>Because tech working group members have some privileges (e.g. being on the mailing list, learning about some investigations early, &#x2026;), there are some responsibilities that we try to hold ourselves to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be good to each other!<ul>
<li>Strive to create an inclusive environment. Especially because tech is skewed white and male, try hard to make those who don&#x2019;t fit the usual &#x201C;tech&#x201D; mold feel welcome.</li>
<li>This hasn&#x2019;t been a problem in the past. Once this becomes a problem, I assume we&#x2019;ll fill this section out :)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Commit to coming to either one or two meetings a week.<ul>
<li><strong>What this means:</strong><ul>
<li>If you commit to coming to two meetings a week going forward, then you try to make it to both meetings a week. If you can&#x2019;t make it to a meeting, you should let folks know on the FB chat.</li>
<li>If you commit to coming to one meeting a week going forward, then you should commit to making either the Tuesday or Wednesday meeting. If you can&#x2019;t make it to that meeting, then you should let folks know on the FB chat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is important because it creates consistency and forward momentum. An approximate definition of a working group member is someone who you expect to see at every meeting unless they say they can&#x2019;t make it. We should hold ourselves to that standard.</li>
<li>This commitment is supposed to be lightweight and shouldn&#x2019;t stress you out! The commitment just means you&#x2019;re going to try your best to make them because <em>you</em> think it&#x2019;s valuable to attend the meetings.</li>
<li><strong>NOTE:</strong> It&#x2019;s okay to miss meetings! Just let folks know every time you&#x2019;re going to miss one.<ul>
<li>If you&#x2019;re busy with work, it&#x2019;s also okay to come to the meeting and just do non-DxE tech work! Doing non-DxE work (or even just hanging out) is always okay at tech meetings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can always change your commitment level. E.g. you get too busy and want to lower it to 1 a week, or you have more free time and want to do 2 meetings a week.</li>
<li>For new members, we encourage them to commit to coming to 2 meetings a week.<ul>
<li>Folks who come to 2 meetings a week tend to have the best experience and most impact, and we want to set new folks up for success.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>TENTATIVE (not in effect yet, still in trial mode)</strong> Come to the monthly DxE Tech retrospective meeting<ul>
<li>The monthly retrospective meeting is important so we can reflect on what we&#x2019;ve done well and what we can improve, and so we can discuss bigger changes to the tech working group.</li>
<li>Ideally, all members (even those on hiatus) will attend.<ul>
<li>We want members on hiatus to come too because we don&#x2019;t want them to become too out of the loop (because they&#x2019;re still on the mailing list). Coming to one meeting every month shouldn&#x2019;t be too much of a burden.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Of course, if you miss one meeting, that&#x2019;s fine. Just let us know you can&#x2019;t make it.</li>
<li>BETA TEST: Make these meetings mandatory if they work out and turn out to be productive.<ul>
<li>Get feedback about meetings and how to improve them</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Opt-in status meetings (not really a responsibility, but something we do)<ul>
<li>Have these at the end of the bi-weekly meetings</li>
<li>These will be opt-in for people actively working on DxE Tech projects<ul>
<li>Basically, people without status updates do not have to attend. You can be in DxE Tech and not work on Tech projects, so we don&#x2019;t want to stress those people out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can certainly opt-out (no pressure!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="hiatus">Hiatus</h1>
<p>If you can no longer commit to going to at least one meeting a week, you can go on hiatus. (Missing one or two weeks is okay). If you are on hiatus, you are still on the mailing list but you&#x2019;re considered &#x201C;on leave&#x201D; from the tech team.</p>
<p>Standards for being on hiatus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coming to at least one meeting a month (even if it&#x2019;s only briefly. It&#x2019;s okay if you work on non-tech team related tasks also)</li>
<li>You are encouraged, but not required, to still interact with people on the mailing list  and FB chat and help out however you can.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="leaving">Leaving</h1>
<p>If you can&#x2019;t commit to one meeting a month, or you really don&#x2019;t want to be on the tech team, you may leave the tech team. (In extraordinary circumstances, you may be asked to leave the tech team.)</p>
<p>When someone leaves the tech team:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove them from the tech working group in the activist database (ask Almira if you don&#x2019;t know how to do that)</li>
<li>Remove them from the FB group</li>
<li>If someone leaves the tech team on good terms, let them know that they can rejoin whenever they want.<ul>
<li>To rejoin the tech team, you need to go through the same procedure for joining as brand new members.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-to-update-the-membership-process">How to update the membership process</h1>
<p>Any changes to the membership process require the consensus of a quorum of members, where a quorum is defined as more than half of the total membership.</p>
